# QuestLog 🗡️📜

QuestLog is a gamified task-tracking web application built with **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy** that transforms everyday todos into RPG-style quests. Users complete quests to earn XP, level up, and stay motivated through game-inspired progression mechanics.

## 🧩 Engineering Challenges

During development, I tackled and solved several non-trivial problems:

### 🔗 Database Relationships  
I designed and implemented relational models using SQLAlchemy to connect users, quests, and progression in a meaningful way.

### ⚡ XP & Leveling Logic  
Built logic that:
- Awards XP when quests are completed  
- Tracks overall XP and calculates when the user levels up

### 📨 Flash Messaging  
Used Flask’s flash system to provide clear, real-time feedback to users for:
- Successful quest adds  
- Quest completion  
- Error handling and invalid input

### 🔄 Flask Architecture  
Organized routes, templates, and models cleanly, improving maintainability and scalability.

- SQLAlchemy ORM and relational database modeling  
- Flask routing and request/response handling  
- Jinja templating for dynamic content  
- Flash message UX patterns  
- Deploying a production-ready web app
